      <p class="mar-top-10">To tell their story better through their website. The current website promotes their services and portfolio of projects completed in the past, however it lacks the ability to illustrate the companies business model, key values and the positive impact it's business model has on all the communities it is involved in.</p>

        <p class="mar-top-10">Timber Construction Solutions often competes with businesses local and internationally for private and public building and housing project contracts in countries all around the world. The majority of the clients users are often from a corporate and/or government agency who use the website to gain insights into the company and aid in assessing their credibility and capabilities.</p>

      <div class="wrk-title font-2-5 font-light">Process</div>
      <p class="mar-top-10">Before any design work was undertaken, 2 weeks were set aside to understanding and familiarising myself with the company, their background, users and business model. Building a strong sense of understanding about the business and their users helped in providing insights into how I could tell their story through the website, while enabling the user to quickly access information easily.</p>
      <p>During the initial design process, a number of solutions were explored through sketches and wireframes including user journey mapping and interactions. Because of the nature and duration of this project I was unable to perform any in depth user testing and analysis to validate my design decisions.</p>

      <p class="mar-top-10">The approach taken featured a large graphic navigation on the homepage using the 5 main stages of the building process, bringing the business model of the company to the forefront of the user. Each page of the website contains a large graphic background image of recent builds or relevant to the current section of the process.</p>
      <p>Each section of the process contains a sub-navigation section with links highlighting the process of each section. The user can then navigate back to the homepage via the company logo or clicking on home in the breadcrumbs.</p>
