      <p class="mar-top-10">To tell their story better through their website. The current website promotes their services and portfolio of projects they have completed in the past, however it lacks the ability to illustrate the companies business model, key values and the positive impact it has on all the communities it is involved in.</p>

The majority of the clients users are from a corporate and/or government agency who use the website to gain an insight to the company and aid in assessing their credibility and capabilities.</p>

      <p class="mar-top-10">Before any design work was undertaken, I spent 2 weeks understanding the familiarising myself with the company, their background, users and business model. Building a strong sense of understanding about the business and their users helped in providing insights into how I could tell their story through the website, while enabling the user to quickly access information easily.</p>
      <p>During the initial design process, a number of solutions were explored through sketches and wireframes including user journey mapping and interactions. Because of the nature and duration of this project I was unable to perform any in depth user testing and analysis to validate my design decisions.</p>
